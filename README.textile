a minimalist /sbin/init for Docker, only reap childrens and propagate SIGTERM

h1. Usage

Just put at the end of your _"CMD"_ (a shell script executed by _/bin/sh_ ?) into your Docker PID 1 process:
<pre>
exec /sbin/flex-docker-init
</pre>

h1. Example

Your Dockerfile should looks like:
<pre>
FROM whatever

[...]

COPY /opt/flex_docker_init/flex-docker-init /sbin/flex-docker-init
[...]

CMD ["/bin/sh", "/etc/rc.local.flex-docker"]
</pre>

And of course the end of _"/etc/rc.local.flex-docker"_ should contains:
<pre>
[...]

exec /sbin/flex-docker-init
</pre>
